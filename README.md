# Project-Labyrinth
A project to build, deploy and secure a live honeypot while touching on IT career paths. 

Hello, and thank you for taking the time to view this! This is a personal educational project to build, deploy, secure, and automate a live honeypot. This project serves as a practical exploration of four key IT roles. System Admin, Cloud Engineer, Cybersecurity Engineer and Analyst, and DevOps Engineer, these are fields that interest me, and if they interest you too, you're more than welcome to follow along. We all start somewhere. 

Here is the road map. 

### Phase 1: Local Deployment (System Administrator) 
- Install Ubuntu Server on a local VirtualBox VM.
- Configure networking and firewall (`ufw`).
- Install and verify Nginx web server.

### Phase 2: Cloud Deployment (Cloud Engineer) 
- Provision an AWS EC2 instance.
- Configure AWS Security Groups.
- Deploy Nginx on the cloud server.

### Phase 3: Security Implementation (Cybersecurity Analyst) 
- Install and configure Cowrie honeypot.
- Analyze attack logs.

### Phase 4: Automation (DevOps Engineer) 
- Write a Terraform script to build the infrastructure. 
- Write a shell script to configure the server.
- Commit all code to this GitHub repository.
